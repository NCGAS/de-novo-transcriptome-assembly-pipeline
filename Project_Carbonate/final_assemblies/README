Once you have completed all the assemblies in the top folder (Trinity, TransAbyss, Velvet, and SOAP), and you have run the ./Combine.sh script in each, you will see a file here with the assembly name, i.e. Trinity.fa.

Now, run ./Combine.sh FIRST - this will put all the assemblies together to be run through Evigenes.
After you get a "combined.fa" file, run RunEvigenes.sh.

This will give you several output folders:
inputset:	This is a breakdown of the file you input, as a fa, cds, and aa translation
okayset:	This includes two major sets: *.okay.* and *.okalt.*.  The okay files are the longest ("best") single version of a transcript.  Transcripts that are similar but not identical are stored in the okalt (alternative forms).  You can find the link between the two - see the documentation for evigenes at http://arthropods.eugenes.org/genes2/about/EvidentialGene_trassembly_pipe.html or email help@ncgas.org
dropset:	This is a set of transcripts that were dropped for variaous reasons (each is labeled as to why) - they were perfect duplicates, they lacked the apparence of real transcripts (no cds), etc.  See documentation for descriptions!

Typically, the *.okay.* set is a good putative, filtered transcriptome for you to start with.  It aims to have one representative per loci, which is ideal for mapping/DE/etc.  DO continue with QC.

Ideas or QC:
Quality stat programs (quast is painless):
	N50 
	Transcript length – what are you expectations?
	Gene/isoform ratio – what are your expectations?
	Length metrics - > 1000bp, >5000 bp, >25,000bps

Correctness
	Blast to a similar organism
	GC – does this match expected?

Completeness
	BUSCO – works on transcriptomes too!
	Blast to a similar organism (how much overlap?)
