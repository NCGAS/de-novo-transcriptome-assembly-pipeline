Welcome!  This readme is under construction, however, some useful bits:

1) The tutorial called Assembly Demo (2).pdf will guide you through how to use the workflow

2) There is a video on the background of the workflow here: https://youtu.be/tKK8y5BNBFc

Do note, this video is from our last in person workshop.  We've made some improvements since then!  Mainly, we have made this workflow 
entirely portable.  All the software and dependencies are packaged as singularity containers that can be pulled as needed.  This eliminates 
the need for us to make systems specific workflows for IU's Carbonate and XSEDE's Bridges.  It allows you to download the same code from 
github and run it on your local academic cluster, Amazon web services, Google Cloud, Jetstream (like we will do here), or anywhere else you'd 
like to - without having to individually install software or depend on it already being installed.  The Setup.ba script now sets that up for 
you.  

3) ./Setup.ba -h will give you a starting place to set up the workflow for your environment (also discussed in detail in the tutorial).

4) Requirements for the workflow include:
- You have enough resources to run the assemblies (RAM and storage, which will depends on your data)
- The system has singularity and SLURM if you are on a cluster, or you have root access if you are on a cloud/virtual machine  

If you have a different job handler, you can still edit the scripts to work, and we can help - this is made to be flexible!
